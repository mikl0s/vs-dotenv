# Step 1

Read @guidelines.md

## Step 2

Describe what you learned from @guidelines.md

### Step 3

Run the unit tests for the entire codebase

### Step 4

If there are test failures:

1. Sort the unit test files descending by the number of failures, errors and warnings collected, focusing on the file with the most collected first. Only run unit tests in the file with the most collected.
2. Work on fixing all the failures in that specific unit test file.
3. Run the unit tests again to ensure there are no more failures.
4. Continue to work on the unit tests, fixing any remaining failures or warnings.

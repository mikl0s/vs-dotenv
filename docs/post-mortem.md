# AI Post-Mortem Prompt

After completing each user story, perform a concise post-mortem analysis and document lessons learned that could accelerate similar or related stories in the future.

Create or update a lesson.md file in the docs folder with a compressed format for AI reference. Use the following structure:

1. **Summary**: One-sentence description of the user story.  
2. **Key Insights**: Concise bullet points summarizing lessons learned, focusing on reusable strategies, patterns, or tools.  
3. **References**: Short links or filenames to relevant code, files, or resources.

Ensure the content is as brief as possible without losing actionable detail. Prioritize compression and relevance since this file will only be read by AI to optimize future story prompts.
